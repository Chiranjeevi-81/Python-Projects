# üß† End to End Email Spam Classifier


## üìù Abstract

***Email spam classification*** involves automatically identifying and sorting emails into two categories: **spam (unwanted messages)** and **ham (legitimate messages)**. Techniques like analyzing email content, user behavior, and machine learning models help achieve this. The goal is to keep spam out of your inbox and ensure you receive important emails .


## üîç Methodology

1. **Importing Libraries:**  
   - Libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Sklearn, and others are imported for data manipulation, visualization, and Machine learning model building.

2. **Loading the Dataset:**
   - The dataset containing the multiple rows of spam or not spam message

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   Prepare data for analysis: handle missing values, encode categorical data, scale features, perform feature engineering, split into train-test sets, and normalize data. Ensure data is in a suitable format for machine learning algorithms.

4. **Training the Models:**
   - Each model is compiled using the Support vector machines
   - The models are trained on the training dataset and evaluation is done.

5. **Model Performance Analysis:**
   - Training and validation loss and accuracy are plotted to visualize the models' performance.

6. **Model prediction:**
   - The model is then given a test dataset to check the accuracy and precision of the model with

7. **Deploy:**
   - By using the streamlit library the model is deployed


**Data and Model File Download:**
the Dataset used int the project is taken from kaggle spam Dataset
